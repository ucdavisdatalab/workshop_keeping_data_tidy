# Overview

This workshop introduces learners to best practices for data entry and organization for data-driven projects. With interactive, hands-on examples weâ€™ll practice using data validation tools including filters, restricted vocabularies, and flags in Microsoft Excel. These skills are also applicable to working in Google Sheets, LibreOffice, and other spreadsheet software. At the end of the workshop, learners should be able to identify the best practices for designing a spreadsheet and entering data, compare different data formats, and be able to use spreadsheet software for basic data validation. This workshop is designed for learners who have basic familiarity with spreadsheet programs. No coding experience is required.  All participants will need a computer with Microsoft Excel 2016 or newer, and the latest version of Zoom. 

# Introduction

## Learning Objectives 

After this workshop, participants should be able to:

  * describe the steps in the lifecycle of a data-driven project
  * identify best practices for entering and formatting data in spreadsheets 
  * use tools in Microsoft Excel for data validation and filtering 
  * define restricted vocabularies, data dictionaries and filter keys
  * compare the advantages of different data file formats


## Before Excel: The Data Lifecycle 

Before we begin entering and organizing our data in spreadsheets, we consider the paths our data takes as it moves through our data-driven project as a whole. Where does our data come from? Where is going, what are we going to do with it? Who is it ultimately for? Data scientists call this process the **"data lifecycle"**. 

![](img/usgs_data_lifecycle.png)
*Note: There are many different versions of the data lifecycle, but we particularly like that of the [US Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1265/pdf/of2013-1265.pdf) and [DataOne](https://old.dataone.org/data-life-cycle).*  (Source: [USGS](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1265/pdf/of2013-1265.pdf))


The steps of the data cycle: 

  * **Plan**: planning what data will be collected, how it will be processed, analyzed and stored throughout the project
  * **Acquire**: collecting our data, through measurement tools (i.e. survey instruments, interview transcripts, GPS location loggers, molecular sequencing assays, behavioral observations, etc.) and entering the data in digital form
  * **Process**: processing data to assure quality, cleaning and formatting the data for downstream analyses and storage
  * **Analyze**: exploring and interpreting patterns in data, summarizing and visualizing results, testing hypotheses, and reporting conclusions from datasets
  * **Preserve**: store data in secure way and in formats that ensure long-term accessibility and reuse
  * **Publish/Share**: distribute data through peer-reviewed publications, report submission, and/or archiving data in field-appropriate data depositories/archives for future access and analysis. 

The following processes occur throughout the data lifecycle: 

  * **Describe **: documenting sources of data, keeping records analysis or processing throughout all steps, recording keys to codes and dataset-specific variables, and history of dataset use. 
  * **Manage quality **: following best practices at all steps to ensure quality, transparency and reproducibility throughout the data process. 
  * **Backup and secure ** : backing-up and securing data in secure storage locations at all steps of the process. 
  
When working with Excel, many of us are often at "Acquire" and "Process" stages of this lifecycle. 
In this workshop, we will illustrate best practices that will help with first-time data entry (**Acquire**), data validation, cleaning and filtering (**Process**) as well as discuss formats and version control that will help with preserving data for reuse and accessibility (**Preserve**). 


### Interested in documenting your data?

In an upcoming workshop (March 4th, 2021), we will be discussing metadata and documentation for data-driven projects. This workshop will delve more into the **Describe** process at all steps. (See [here](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/eventscalendar/readme-write-me/) for more information.)
